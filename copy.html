<h1>THE IDEA PAGE</h1>


<b>Chicago. 1921.</b>
<p>A writer at the Chicago Daily News comes to his editor with a big idea.
The writer was Ben Hecht.
The big idea was “just under the edge of the news as commonly understood, the news often flatly and unimaginatively told, lay life; that in this urban life there dwelt the stuff of literature, not hidden in remote places, either, but walking the downtown streets, peering from the windows of skyscrapers, sunning itself in the parks and boulevards. He was going to be its interpreter. He was to be the lens throwing city life into new colors, his the microscope revealing its contortions in life and death. It was no newspaper dream at all, in fact. It was an artist’s dream.” (Henry Justin Smith, 1921)
</p>
<p>
Spanning the realms of journalism and literature, Hecht’s ground-breaking short stories about everyday life in Chicago were first published as a daily column in the newspaper. Sixty-four were later collected together and published as a book entitled “1001 Afternoons in Chicago.”
</p>


<p>
Nearly a century after their publication, the stories continue to inspire. In the spring of 2013, Seth Boustead of Access Contemporary Music (http://acmusic.org/) (SIDE NOTE: Instead of displaying the link, is there a way to link the address to the name “Access Contemporary Music”?) decided to reimagine the stories in a radio play format featuring brand new original music scores. Collaborating with Andersen Lawfer and Mike Dailey of the Strawdog Theatre Company (http://www.strawdog.org/) (SIDE NOTE: Is there a way to link the address to the name “Strawdog Theatre Company”?)(SIDE NOTE: Is there a way to link the address to the name “Access Contemporary Music”?), Seth and Amos Gillespie composed musical scores for six of the stories from 1001 Afternoons in Chicago.
The project premiered with more than 20 actors and musicians performing live (Can we make the live performance link provided below link to the words “performing live”?) at Architectural Artifacts in Ravenswood on May 21st.

<p>
While the performance project was just beginning, filmmaker Dave Less was struck by how the stories were inspiring interpretations into new and different art forms. 
</p>
<p>
“What was it in these stories that allowed so many different artists to find inspiration in them? The answer, to me, is that through all sixty-four different stories about hundreds of people, a single character is always present, looming above it all: the city. There was something here that revealed the connection between urban life and art. Living in a city, you are directly connected to its cultural history, and few works of art are so totally rooted in the city as 1001 Afternoons in Chicago. Hecht’s stories are taken from observations of simply wandering the streets. The same streets that we wander today. You can’t walk two blocks through the city without being inspired by its beauty and confronted by its terrors. It doesn’t allow for complacency. So I wanted to take the stories, voices and music, and add to them through film the looming, almost like fate, presence of the city. 
</p>


<h1>THE FILM PAGE</h1>

<p>
“We want the film to do many things at once. To be a document of new artistic interpretations of the stories, to convey how the city links artists of the past and present, and to visualize the duality of Hecht’s city, its gritty textures alongside its soaring inspirations. So just as the stories blurred the lines between journalism and literature, I decided the film could similarly blurs the lines between traditional documentary and narrative.” (Dave Less)
</p>
<p>
Produced by Half King Productions, the film will present four of the stories from 1001 Afternoons in Chicago: Grass Figures, Don Quixote and The Last Windmill, Dapper Pete and the Sucker Play, and Clocks and Owl Cars, through the blending of four types of footage.
<ol>
<li>The Straw Dog actors and the Access Contemporay Musicians performing their adaptations and interpretations of the stories. Their voices and music will be the audio bed for the entire film.
</li>
<li>
2. Archival footage of Chicago from the 1920s through the present.
</li>
</li>
<li>
3. New Chicago footage filmed in the present day.
</li>
<li>
4. Animation. 
</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
The blending of these elements cinematically conveys the idea that through the conduit of the city itself, these stories are constantly being reborn and re-imagined by the next generation of artists that they inspire. 
</p>

<h1>GET INVOLVED PAGE</h1>
<p>
Based on the theme that Hecht’s stories are endlessly being recreated by artists through time, this film is asking Chicago artists to help supply the visual content. The film’s director, Dave Less, will edit the footage together, but the film will include as many original views and interpretations as possible. 
</p>
<p>
We want to give artists the opportunity for their own work and vision to be seen. Rather than dictating how something is created, we will supply a general callout for artists and a section of text from the stories. We hope that artists will create something that was inspired by the text.
</p>
<p>
We invite artists to take part in this rare opportunity to celebrate the city’s inspiration by creating an artistic project about and for Chicago.
</p>
<p>
The filming of the ACM and Strawdog theatrical performance is complete. We are now beginning to recruit artists of all types from all over the city to add their touch to the vision of the film through animation, footage, photography, or any other type of visual art.
